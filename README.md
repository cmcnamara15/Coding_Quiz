# Code-Quiz

## Description

This project was a great exercise in JavaScript! As a developer my goal was to better understand how to use JavaScript as a vessel to create something that resembled the mock up given. This wasn't designed for style as much as it was designed for functionality. Upon first submission I still have quite a few things to work out in regards to the end of the game. All in all though I am excited to share this project as a milestone along my journey of becoming a software engineer.

### Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## User Story
